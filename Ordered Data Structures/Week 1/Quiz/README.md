# Problem Statement

Write functions that reverse the elements in a stack and in a queue. The starter code below include the STL `<stack>` and `<queue>` data structures.

A stack of integers is declared as `std::stack<int>` and the stack's `top()` member function returns the integer at the top of the stack (but also leaves it at the top of the stack). The `push()` method pushes a new integer onto the top of the stack and the `pop()` method deletes the value at the top of the stack.

A queue of integers is declared as `std::queue<int>` and the queue's `front()` member function returns the integer at the front of the queue (but also leaves it at the front of the queue). The `push()` method pushes a new integer onto the back of the queue and the `pop()` method deletes the value at the front of the queue.

Your job is to implement procedures that reverse the order of elements in a stack, and in a queue. The procedures `print_stack()` and `print_queue()` are provided to help you see if your procedures work.
